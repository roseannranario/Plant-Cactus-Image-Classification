![Training Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f691fab2-f004-464a-96fe-2f1e9db8a8c8)

**Explanation:**

This Teachable Machine project classifies 4 cactus types with 250 images each, using standard training defaults. Epochs: 100 means the model sees the full dataset 100 times, enough to learn without overfitting. Batch Size: 64 means 64 images are processed per weight update, balancing speed and stability for a 1,000-image dataset. Learning Rate: 0.001 controls how cautiously the model adjusts its weights each step — small enough to converge smoothly, large enough to train efficiently. Together, these three values represent a well-balanced, beginner-friendly configuration suitable for a small, evenly distributed image classification task like this one.

### Reflection Questions

**1. How did the number of images per class affect your model's accuracy?**

The number of images per class had a significant impact on the model's accuracy. Classes with more training images gave the model more visual patterns to learn from, resulting in better recognition. Classes with fewer images likely led to underfitting, where the model couldn't generalize well. For a 20-class cactus model, having an unequal number of images per class (class imbalance) may have caused the model to favor the classes with more data, reducing overall accuracy for underrepresented species.

**2. Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?**

Species that look visually similar are the most likely to be misclassified. For example, pairs like Pencil Cactus and Totem Pole Cactus, or Thimble Cactus and Corn Cob Cactus, share similar shapes and textures. Since your model uses grayscale images, color differences between species are completely lost, making it even harder to distinguish visually similar cacti. Species with unique and distinct shapes like Moon Cactus or Fishbone Cactus were likely classified more accurately.

**3. How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?**

Epochs — Increasing epochs allowed the model more time to learn, improving accuracy up to a point. Too many epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes training data but performs poorly on new images. Batch Size — A smaller batch size makes training slower but can lead to a more generalized model. A larger batch size speeds up training but may miss finer patterns. Learning Rate — A high learning rate causes the model to learn too fast and overshoot the optimal solution, reducing accuracy. A lower learning rate trains more carefully but takes longer. Finding the right balance is key to a well-performing model.

**4. What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?**

Common challenges in a project like this include finding enough high-quality images for all 20 cactus species, especially rare ones. Some challenges likely encountered are inconsistent image backgrounds making it harder for the model to focus on the plant itself, images taken from different angles or lighting conditions adding noise to the data, visually similar species being accidentally mislabeled, and the time-consuming process of manually collecting and organizing images into 20 separate labeled classes.

**5. If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?**

Several improvements could boost the model's performance. First, collecting more images per class, aiming for at least 100–200 per species, would give the model more to learn from. Second, using color images instead of grayscale would preserve important visual differences between species. Third, applying data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and adjusting brightness would artificially expand the dataset. Fourth, ensuring a balanced number of images per class would prevent the model from being biased toward certain species. Finally, fine-tuning the learning rate and increasing epochs gradually while monitoring for overfitting would lead to a more accurate and reliable model.
