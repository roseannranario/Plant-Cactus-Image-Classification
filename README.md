<img width="1034" height="748" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f691fab2-f004-464a-96fe-2f1e9db8a8c8" />
Explaination : 
     This Teachable Machine project classifies 4 cactus types with 250 images each, using standard training defaults. Epochs: 100 means the model sees the full dataset 100   
     times, enough to learn without overfitting. Batch Size: 64 means 64 images are processed per weight update, balancing speed and stability for a 1,000-image dataset. 
     Learning Rate: 0.001 controls how cautiously the model adjusts its weights each step — small enough to converge smoothly, large enough to train efficiently. Together, 
     these three values represent a well-balanced, beginner-friendly configuration suitable for a small, evenly distributed image classification task like this one.

        A. Project Overview
           - This project is an image classification model built using Google's Teachable Machine. It was trained to recognize and classify 20 different species of cacti, 
             using grayscale images at a resolution of 96x96 pixels. The model was exported in TensorFlow.js format, making it compatible for deployment in web-based 
             applications.Classified Cactus Species,Red Thorn Cactus, Blue Candle Cactus, Peanut Cactus, Joseph Coat Cactus, Angel Wing Cactus, Prickly Pear Cactus, Fairy 
             Castle Cactus, Pencil Cactus, Old Man Cactus, Totem Pole Cactus, Corn Cob Cactus, Thimble Cactus, Pine Cone Cactus, Paper Spine Cactus, Domino Cactus, Star 
             Cactus, Bishop's Cap Cactus, Fishbone Cactus, Moon Cactus, and Cholla Cactus.
          
           - The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify different species of cacti from images. This can be useful for plant enthusiasts, 
             students, botanists, or gardeners who want a quick and easy way to identify cactus types without expert knowledge. By leveraging Teachable Machine, the model                makes cactus species recognition accessible and can be embedded into a website or app for real-time identification.
