<img width="1034" height="748" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f691fab2-f004-464a-96fe-2f1e9db8a8c8" />
Explaination : 
     This Teachable Machine project classifies 4 cactus types with 250 images each, using standard training defaults. Epochs: 100 means the model sees the full dataset 100   
     times, enough to learn without overfitting. Batch Size: 64 means 64 images are processed per weight update, balancing speed and stability for a 1,000-image dataset. 
     Learning Rate: 0.001 controls how cautiously the model adjusts its weights each step — small enough to converge smoothly, large enough to train efficiently. Together, 
     these three values represent a well-balanced, beginner-friendly configuration suitable for a small, evenly distributed image classification task like this one.

        A. Project Overview
           - This project is an image classification model built using Google's Teachable Machine. It was trained to recognize and classify 20 different species of cacti, 
             using grayscale images at a resolution of 96x96 pixels. The model was exported in TensorFlow.js format, making it compatible for deployment in web-based 
             applications.Classified Cactus Species,Red Thorn Cactus, Blue Candle Cactus, Peanut Cactus, Joseph Coat Cactus, Angel Wing Cactus, Prickly Pear Cactus, Fairy 
             Castle Cactus, Pencil Cactus, Old Man Cactus, Totem Pole Cactus, Corn Cob Cactus, Thimble Cactus, Pine Cone Cactus, Paper Spine Cactus, Domino Cactus, Star 
             Cactus, Bishop's Cap Cactus, Fishbone Cactus, Moon Cactus, and Cholla Cactus.
          
           - The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify different species of cacti from images. This can be useful for plant enthusiasts, 
             students, botanists, or gardeners who want a quick and easy way to identify cactus types without expert knowledge. By leveraging Teachable Machine, the model                makes cactus species recognition accessible and can be embedded into a website or app for real-time identification.

               Common name: Red Thorn Cactus
               Scientific name: Echinocactus grusonii
               Description: A striking barrel-shaped cactus featuring vibrant red or reddish-brown spines that create a dramatic contrast against its green body. This   
                            spherical cactus grows slowly and can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The colorful spines provide both protection and visual appeal, making it a                             popular choice for desert gardens and collectors.

               Common name: Blue Candle Cactus
               Scientific name: Myrtillocactus geometrizans
               Description: A columnar cactus with a distinctive blue-gray or blue-green waxy coating that gives it its name. It grows in a candelabra-like formation with   
                            multiple upright branches. This fast-growing cactus can reach heights of 12-15 feet and produces small white flowers followed by edible purple                               berries. The powdery blue coating helps reflect sunlight and conserve water.

               Common name: Peanut Cactus
               Scientific name: Echinopsis chamaecereus
               Description: A low-growing, clustering cactus with finger-like stems that resemble peanuts, hence its common name. It produces brilliant orange-red tubular 
               flowers in spring and summer. The stems are covered with soft, short spines and readily form dense mats. This easy-to-grow cactus is perfect for beginners  
               and produces stunning blooms that can completely cover the plant.

               Common name: Joseph Coat Cactus 
               Scientific name: Opuntia monacantha variegata
               Description: A spectacular variegated prickly pear featuring flat,paddle-shaped pads with stunning cream, pink, and purple coloration. The variegation   
                            creates a mottled,multi-colored appearance that resembles Joseph's coat from biblical stories. New growth is particularly vibrant with pink and                              red tones. This ornamental cactus is prized more for its foliage than its flowers.

               Common name: Angel Wing Cactus
               Scientific name: Opuntia microdasys
               Description: A distinctive pad-shaped cactus covered in dense clusters of white glochids (tiny hair-like spines) that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance 
                            resembling angel wings.The oval-shaped pads are bright green and the white polka-dot pattern of spine clusters creates an attractive contrast.                               Despite its innocent appearance, the glochids detach easily and can be irritating to skin.
             

         6.  
               Common name: Prickly Pear Cactus
               Scientific name: Opuntia ficus-indica
               Description: One of the most recognizable cactus types, featuring flat,oval pads that grow in segments. The pads are covered with both large spines and tiny                              glochids. It produces showy flowers in various colors (yellow, orange, red, or pink) followed by edible fruits called tunas. Both the pads    
                            (nopales) and fruits are widely used in Mexican and Southwestern cuisine. This hardy cactus can tolerate various climates.


         7.  
               Common name: Fairy Castle Cactus
               Scientific name:  Acanthocereus tetragonus 
               Description: A unique columnar cactus with irregular, twisted growth that resembles the turrets and spires of a fairy tale castle. Its stems branch in all 
                            directions creating a miniature architectural sculpture. The plant has five sides with small spines along the ridges. It rarely flowers indoors 
                            but can produce large white nocturnal blooms when mature. This slow-growing cactus is popular for its whimsical appearance.


         8. 
               Common name: Pencil Cactus
               Scientific name: Euphorbia tirucalli
               Description: Despite its name, this is actually a succulent euphorbia, not a true cactus. It features thin, pencil-like branches that grow in dense clusters.                             The stems are typically green but can turn orange-red or yellow in bright light or stress conditions ('Firesticks' variety). Warning: 
                            contains toxic white latex sap that can cause severe skin and eye irritation. This architectural plant can grow quite large and is popular in  
                            modern landscapes.


         9.
               Common name: Old Man Cactus
               Scientific name: Cephalocereus senilis
               Description: An iconic columnar cactus covered in long, white, hair- like spines that drape down its sides like an old man's beard. The soft white & hair; 
                            can grow up to 5 inches long and completely covers the green body underneath. Native to Mexico, it grows slowly and can eventually reach 15                                  feet tall. Pink flowers appear near the top of mature specimens. The hairy covering protects the plant from both intense sun and cold   
                            temperatures.
